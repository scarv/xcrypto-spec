# XCrypto: a cryptographic ISE for RISC-V

*This project describes a complete Instruction Set Extension (ISE) for the
RISC-V architecture for accelerating cryptographic workloads. It is
accompanied by an area-optimised implementation of the ISE, which acts as
a co-processor. An example integration of the co-processor with the PicoRV32
CPU core is included.*

This project contains the ISE specification document.
